  <p class="paragraph">AMBULANCE officers say they may refuse to continue administering a powerful pain-relieving drug.
They want state governments agree to pay an extra $1.90 per dose to protect them from its harmful effects. The drug, methoxyflurane, is used on a daily basis by Australian paramedics, although the US Food and Drug Administration banned it six years ago after finding repeated use was "associated with serious, irreversible, and even fatal" kidney and liver toxicity.<br><br>
But the Emergency Medical Service Protection Association, which represents more than 2500 paramedics, says it is outraged over the lack of action to buy cheap carbon filters that it says would protect paramedics from having to breathe the drug in the cramped conditions inside ambulances.
As an inhaled drug, methoxyflurane is administered through a plastic cylinder that the patient puts to their mouth and breathes through. While the drug is known to be effective in relieving pain, only a proportion of each dose is absorbed by the patient's lungs, with the rest exhaled back into the surroundings when the patient breathes out.<br><br>
The medicine's official product information warns daily use of the drug over several days is not recommended because of the risk of kidney damage and says the "use of methods to reduce occupational exposure to methoxyflurane", such as carbon filters, should be considered.
The EMPSA claims dangers posed by the drug are "well documented", and earlier this year doctors in Brisbane reported the case of a 33-year-old woman who developed hepatitis after receiving three doses.<br><br>
A survey of the EMPSA's Queensland members showed many were concerned about using the drug, especially in the cramped confines of ambulances; 71 per cent had experienced headaches while administering it, 45 per cent reported dizziness and 33.5 per cent said they became nauseous.
The EMPSA's Queensland secretary Craig Bindley says although each filter can only be used for one patient, as the inhaling devices are not reusable, their $1.90 cost is "not much", given that each dose already costs state governments more than $20.<br><br>
"If they are not prepared to put that sort of effort into our health and safety, I think that's disgusting," Bindley says.
He says ambulance officers would consider their options, including refusing to administer the drug, if ambulance services in NSW, Queensland and Victoria did not introduce filters by the end of this year.<br><br>
Tony Walker, general manager of regional services for Ambulance Victoria, says a study by his organsiation found the "only benefit of the filters was in odour absorption" and that paramedics are not exposed to dangerous levels of the drug.
"While we are aware of the US FDA ban , this was based on much higher dosage anaesthetic concentrations,
and the Therapeutic Goods Adminstration has approved the drug for use in Australia as pain relief medication," Walker says.
