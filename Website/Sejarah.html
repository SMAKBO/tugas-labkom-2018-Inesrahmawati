<h1>History of Methoxyflurane</h1>
<body>
	<p>All of the current used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from the synthesis of Freon ( Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering , 1928) [58] and the discovery of Teflon ( Roy J. Plunkett , 1938), [59] The field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted a great deal of attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine , which has been produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project , during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.

The need for fluorine arose from the need to separate the isotope 235 U from 238 U for the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons ) , [60] whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti ) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. [61] After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride , UF 6 , was determined to be the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. [62] Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF 6 .

Significant obstacles have to be overcome in the handling of both fluorine and UF 6 . Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop UF 6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance ). William T. Miller, [63] professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University , was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.

Charles Suckling synthesized halothane in 1951. Halothane was the first organofluorine anesthetic agent to be introduced into clinical practice in 1956. [64] Miller and his team continued to develop organofluorine chemistry after the end of World War II and methoxyflurane was synthesized in 1948.</p>
